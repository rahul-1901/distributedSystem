          <p>
            For coding-format events, combine automatic verification
            (correctness) with secondary metrics like time or memory, and be
            explicit about which test cases are public versus hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            For project-style hackathons, score idea, execution, demo
            quality, and impact separately, and use 2–3 judges so subjective
            scores get averaged rather than resting on one opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you add an audience vote, disclose its weight up front and
            take steps to prevent duplicate voting.

          metadata — timestamps, IPs — for audits, and disclose that logging
          in your event's privacy notice. Keep the appeals process
